description: As part of achieving the Eagle Rank, I had the opportunity to complete an Eagle Scout project. A friend of mine runs a non-profit horse ranch that offers free services to those with disabilities as a way to give back to the community. To help them more efficiently offer their services, I built a fully furnished and plumbed handicap bathroom on the ranch. This included installing a 200 gallon sepctic tank, dealing with all the piping, and building the wooden structure itself. Another major part of this project was raising the $5000 needed for materials and leading others in the 500+ man-hour endeavour. I'm incredibly grateful for all the volunteers that offered their time to the project and I'm proud of the final result.
