description: I have officially achieved my goal of becoming a paramotor pilot! Only took 8 nights of camping, 9 days of training, and 17 flights/I had the opportunity to meet some amazing people and I really enjoyed the learning process. Proud to be a new member of Team Fly Halo and looking forward to the freedom to fly anywhere when I eventually get my own gear. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIzwVNALpFp/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Instagram Link</a>
