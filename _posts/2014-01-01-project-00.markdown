description: Created a Scheme interepreter in Python. The goal of the project was to create an interpreter that had all the functionality of the web interpreter in the picture and linked below. I learned the intricacies of Python and mastered the syntax of Scheme. Unfortunately the Github is forced to be private because it's a class project; shoot me an email if you have any specific questions!
