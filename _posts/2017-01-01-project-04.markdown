description: As Valedictorian of Murrieta Valley High School I had the opportunity to give a speech to my peers summarizing our time together and offering some words of advice for the future. <p></p> Honestly though, I was mostly just excited for the opportunity to ask to be on the TV-show Survivor. It's always been a dream of mine to be on the show and I felt like this platform would be a fun way of 'spicing up' my audition tape. Not super noble or anything, but I still have the dream and I hope that one day I'll be able to play. I'm confident I'd win. <p></p> Check out the first 45 seconds of my speech if you are interested in hearing the Survivor stuff! <br> (I had to go off-script so watch the Principal and Superintendent's expressions if you want to see a bit of anxiety)
