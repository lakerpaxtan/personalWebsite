description: The ISAACS Radiation Visualization project was born from Kai Vetter's lab at LBL reaching out to research scientist Allen Yang in the Augmented Cognition Lab asking for help visualization UAV-collected radiation data from Fukushima. As a veteran of the original ISAACS project, Allen asked me to spearhead this new project. The majority of my work on this project was leading negotiations between labs to come up with a satisfying goal. My personal goal was to develop my project management skills, and with the differing desires of both labs, the meeting negotiations allowed me to do this often. Near the end of the semester we were also able to create small prototype radiation viz MVP's using pointcloud manipulation in Unity. Shortly after the goal negotations were completed, I passed the project on to one of my coworkers in order to focus on the development of the ISAACS research paper.
