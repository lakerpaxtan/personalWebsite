description: "In an effort to extend the reach of the VR DeCal and graduate student VR Development course I had taught the previous two semesters, I petitioned to make the VR Education Branch, a branch in VR@Berkeley that hosts all education-purposed teams. As the first branch in VR@Berkeley, we have fostered a large community of people and teams devoted to spreading our passion for VR. Our current teams under the education branch include: DeCal Team (5 people), Workshops Team (4 people), Modules Team (4 people), VR Textbook Team (4 people), Research Team (4 people). I actively lead meetings between these teams to facilitate resources between VR@Berkeley and these VR Education Branch teams as the VR Education Branch Lead. As VR Education Branch Lead, I am also one of four executives making decisions for VR@Berkeley, the nation's largest undergraduate VR club with around 150 active club members."
