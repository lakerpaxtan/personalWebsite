description: In frustration with time-delay assosciated with the current measurment app that all iPhone come preloaded with, I wanted to make my own measurment app. It's a fairly simple and convenient app that leans on ARCore heavily and allows you to measure between any two points without any delay. The cost of removing the delay comes with loss of accuracy if measuring too quickly.
