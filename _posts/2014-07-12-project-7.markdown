description: The purpose of the STAC High Altitude Baloon team is to create inexpensive and accessible ways for companies and organizations to test their experiments in low gravity, high altitude environments. I joined the STAC High Altitude Balloon team as a project engineer in both hardware and software engineering. I designed a custom PCB in KiCad to standardize and increase success rate of HAB launches by modularizing component functionality. I developed software to track and communicate with the HAB payload up to 100k feet. I assisted in creating hypotheses to pair with our experients to test the effects of high-altitude, low-gravity environments.
