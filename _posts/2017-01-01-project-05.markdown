description: Offered to various "leaders" among different campus communities, I was given the opportunity to visit Israel and Palestine to study their poltical conflicts. It was an incredibly enlightening trip and I was honored to be sponsored for the trip. I was a representative of the "Tech" majors on campus and it really helped offer new perspectives. Political science has always been something I've been interested in on a "hobby" level so this trip was a treat for me.
