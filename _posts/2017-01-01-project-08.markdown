description: How it works -> Teams of 8 run roughly 120 miles—in three repeating loops—on wilderness trails that wind through forests, valleys, and mountainsides. You’ll run day, and night, and day again, sleeping (yeah right) in a temporary tent city known as Ragnar Village. <br> <br> As part of a high school club, myself and many of my peers participated in the Ragnar Relay race twice. It was incredibly fulfilling and fun.
