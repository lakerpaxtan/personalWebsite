description: Created a local multiplayer game in Java that creates procedurally generated psuedo-random maps. The goal of the game is for player 1 to "tag" player 2 within map boundaries. The main goal of the project was to better my Java skills and learn the ropes of procedural generation. The game also features save-states, a main menu, and other options within the UI.
